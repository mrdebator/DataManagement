Previous research on statistical learning, including studies on phonetic learning, indicates that infants can learn from audio- only exposure when exposure consists of a small number of artificial language stimuli (7–9). However, the current experi- ment offers a far greater challenge for infants. In the present case, infants are exposed to tens of thousands of syllables embedded in natural language spoken by a range of speakers, with no isolation of the test sounds. We hypothesized that under this natural and more complex learning situation, social inter- action would play a role in learning. Experiments show, for example, that an infant turning to follow an adult’s line of regard, ‘‘gaze following’’ (32), is a predictor of an infant’s social aware- ness and future language performance (33, 34).
In Experiment 2, we tested whether the presence of a live person is critical to phonetic learning in our experimental situation. The same foreign-language material was presented to infants via studio-quality DVDs that consisted of either AV or A information. Experiment 2 thus tested foreign-language learn- ing in a ‘‘passive listening’’ situation, comparing the results with those of Experiment 1, which involved more ‘‘active listening,’’ holding all other factors constant.
