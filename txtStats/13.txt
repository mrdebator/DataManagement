During the sessions, infants sat on a blanket in a sound-treated room, in groups of one to three, about 3 ft from the speaker. Speakers made frequent eye contact with infants and used each infant’s name during the sessions. Mothers sat in the room during the exposure sessions but did not interact with their infants. Word counts of the recorded natural language sessions revealed that infants heard between 25,989 and 42,184 Mandarin Chinese syllables (M 􏰂 33,120) over the course of the 12 sessions. Mandarin Chinese test stimuli. After completion of the 12 exposure sessions, infants were tested by using a computer-synthesized version of a Mandarin Chinese phonetic contrast that does not occur in English, an alveolo-palatal affricate (􏰉t􏰊h􏰉) and an alveolo-palatal fricative (􏰉􏰊􏰉). Spectrographic depictions of the two syllables are shown in Fig. 1. The two syllables were 375 ms in duration; had identical steady-state vowel formant frequencies of 293, 2,274, 3,186, and 3,755 Hz, respectively; bandwidths of 80, 90, 150, and 350 Hz, respectively; and a fundamental frequency of 120 Hz (high-flat tone, Tone 1 in Mandarin). The syllables differed only in the point of maximum rise in amplitude during the initial 130-ms frication portion. The affricate consonant had a fast amplitude rise, with maximum amplitude occurring at 􏰀30 ms; the fricative consonant had a slower amplitude rise time, with maximum amplitude occurring at 􏰀100 ms. Tokens were equalized in rms amplitude and played to infants at a comfort- able listening level of 65 dBA. Mandarin native-speaking adults show near perfect discrimination of these two computer- synthesized Mandarin sounds, whereas American English native speakers are significantly worse (19). Syllable counts of the exposure sessions showed that among the natural syllables
