7 years ago, I was a very pregnant 23 year old finishing GED classes at the local college so I could continue to receive state funding for low income families.

My counselor saw my GED test scores, which she said were the highest she had seen during her time at the college. Then, she suggested I look into a career in STEM. I had no idea what she was talking about.

Today, I am finishing my last quarter at the University of Washington and will be the first in my family to receive a bachelors degree, and in Computer Science no less.

I am excitedly looking forward to starting my new career at HBO and giving my son the life he always deserved.

I am grateful to never have to apply for state or government programs ever again.

Iâ€™m not sure where that college counselor is now, but I owe her a huge thanks for being the first person who opened my eyes to what my life could be, and today, what my life is.
