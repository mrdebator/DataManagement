The Team Awareness Kit (TAK) is a digital tool that greatly enhances coordination and collaboration among response teams. This innovative solution enables tactical data to be generated, visualized, and securely shared. The tool facilitates daily operations for public safety organizations and allows different organizations that donâ€™t regularly communicate to seamlessly come together and maintain shared tactical awareness during a disaster or special event.
