Methods and Materials. Participants. The participants were 32 full-term infants, assigned randomly to one of two groups: 16 (eight boys) to the Mandarin exposure group and 16 (eight boys) to the English control group. Criteria for infant participants included: (i) English as the only language spoken in the house- hold; (ii) no known physical, sensory, or mental handicap; (iii) gestational age at birth at 40 􏰁 3 weeks; and (iv) birth weight between 5.5 and 10 lb. The mean age of infant participants when the language exposure sessions began was 9.3 mo (􏰂282.71 days) (range 􏰂 275–314 days) for the Mandarin exposure group and 9.3 mo (􏰂284.59 days) (range 􏰂 265–319 days) for the English control group. Of the 32 infants who began the exposure sessions, 21 completed all 12 of the exposure sessions and the behavioral testing (10 in the Mandarin exposure group and 11 in the control group).
Language exposure sessions. Infants took part in 12 language sessions, each 25 min in duration, scheduled over a 4-wk period. During these sessions, native speakers of Mandarin (or English) read from children’s books for 10 min and played with toys for 15 min using prescribed materials. Children’s storybooks were translated into Mandarin for the reading period, and various toys (puppets, a train, and ring stacks) were provided for the adults to use during the play period. The same materials were used to interact with infants during each session. Four native Mandarin (or English) speakers (both male and female) took turns con- ducting the language sessions so that infants were exposed to a variety of speaking styles over the 12 sessions.
