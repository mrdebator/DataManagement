Most Americans see privacy issues in commercial settings as contingent and contextdependent.
A new Pew Research Center study based on a survey of 461 U.S. adults and
nine online focus groups of 80 people finds that there are a variety of circumstances
under which many Americans would share personal information or permit
surveillance in return for getting something of perceived value. For instance, a
majority of Americans think it would be acceptable (by a 54% to 24% margin) for
employers to install monitoring cameras following a series of workplace thefts. Nearly
half (47%) say the basic bargain offered by retail loyalty cards – namely, that stores
track their purchases in exchange for occasional discounts – is acceptable to them,
even as a third (32%) call it unacceptable.
