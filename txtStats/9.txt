A second issue investigated in the present experiments is whether phonetic learning during this period is enhanced by social interaction. There is evidence in other species, such as songbirds, that learning is enhanced by social interaction (22). In humans, it has been argued that social interaction is critical for language learning (23), but few experimental data exist to test the hypothesis.
The present experiments address these two questions. In Experiment 1, we examined whether exposure to Ùè∞Ä5 h of natural infant-directed Mandarin Chinese between 9 and 10 mo of age is sufficient to reverse the decline typically seen in foreign- language phonetic perception. A control group also experienced 5 h of natural language but heard only English. The age of 9 mo was chosen to begin exposure, because infant studies show that the decline in foreign-language phonetic perception is well underway by this time (18). The results of Experiment 1 con- firmed the hypothesis: infants exposed to Mandarin reversed the decline in Mandarin phonetic perception shown in the English control group. In Experiment 2, we tested whether social inter- action contributed to learning. The same foreign-language ma- terial was presented to American 9-mo-old infants using either auditory-visual (AV) or auditory-only (A) DVDs. The results of Experiment 2 provided no evidence of phonetic learning, sug- gesting an important role for social interaction in early language learning, perhaps analogous to the role social interaction plays in avian song learning.
