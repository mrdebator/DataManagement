Language acquisition poses profound questions about the human mind and brain that have prompted an ongoing debate (1). Recently, experimental studies on young infants suggest a new view of the language acquisition process that goes beyond classic theories.
Studies show that, during the first year of life, infants acquire detailed information about the regularities of their native lan- guage (2–5). Moreover, there is increasing evidence that infant learning relies on sensitivity to the statistical properties con- tained in language input. By 6 mo, infants recognize native- language phonetic categories based on the distributional char- acteristics of the speech they hear (6, 7). Between 6 and 8 mo, infants segment words from ongoing speech by detecting tran- sitional probabilities between syllables (8, 9) and extract the arithmetic regularity of syllable combinations from sentences (10). At 9 mo of age, infants are sensitive to the phonotactic rules governing words, responding to the probability of occurrence of phonetic sequences (11, 12). By the end of the first year of life, infants’ perception of speech has been dramatically altered by exposure to their native language.
Exposure to a particular language has another consequence: it reduces sensitivity to foreign-language speech. At the phonetic level, exposure to a specific language reduces infants’ abilities to discriminate foreign-language speech sounds. Early in life, in- fants readily discern differences among the phonetic units used in the world’s languages (13, 14); as adults, we no longer do so (15, 16). The change occurs early in development; infants’ abilities to discriminate foreign-language phonetic units decline sharply between 6 and 12 mo of age (17, 18). This transition is well documented but thus far unexplained.
