Open-access data might be beneficial to society,  while there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood, although access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong, for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries.
