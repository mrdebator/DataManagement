Results. The results demonstrate that live exposure to Mandarin Chinese at 9 mo of age reverses the decline typically seen in foreign-language speech perception, a decline experimentally verified by the English control group. The results demonstrate the effects of foreign-language intervention (Fig. 2A).
Performance on the Mandarin phonetic contrast differed significantly for infants in the Mandarin exposure (M 􏰂 65.7%, SE 􏰂 2.40) and English control groups (M 􏰂 56.7%, SE 􏰂 2.29), F (1, 19) 􏰂 7.34, P 􏰆 0.05. The same pattern of results was seen using the d􏰄 measure. Performance on the American English 􏰉ra-la􏰉contrast did not differ for the Mandarin exposure and English control groups (P 􏰇 0.10), indicating that the two groups of infants were equally skilled at native-language phonetic perception. The attention scores demonstrate that infants in the Mandarin (M 􏰂 3.53, range 􏰂 2.71– 4.00) and English (M 􏰂 3.59, range 􏰂 2.94 – 4.06) groups were highly attentive, and that their scores did not differ significantly (P 􏰇 0.10).
The current results can be compared with our previous findings of similarly aged children tested in Taiwan, who had been raised listening to their native Mandarin language (Fig. 2C) (19). The previous research compared Mandarin speech dis- crimination in Chinese and American infants tested in their home countries. The same experimenters, using the same Man- darin stimuli, conducted the study, allowing a direct comparison. The results show that performance of the American infants
